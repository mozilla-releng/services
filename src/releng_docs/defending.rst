Defending Release Engineering Services Design
=============================================

Why everything in one repository?
---------------------------------

In evironment where there are many small and very similar services it makes
sense to benefit the cost of maintaining and supporting this services. 

Another reason is also to improve developers discovaribility of services
accross *Release Engineering Team*. 

In longer term, once more services are migrated to ``mozilla-releng/service``,
better overview of what is running, and how is it running, will be provided for
management team to do better decidions going forward.
