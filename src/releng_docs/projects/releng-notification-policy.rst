RelEng Notification Policy is a tool to send RelEng related notifications based
on periodic policies, and escalate unacknowledged notifications to higher
urgency levels. Message requests are sent to the service with details on who to
notify and how urgent the message is. Policies for how to notify these
stakeholders are retrieved from the RelEng Notification Identity service.
