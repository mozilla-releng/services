Mozilla Release Engineering Services
====================================

A highlevel goal of *Release Engineering Services* is to **converge efforts**
to develop, test, maintain and *most importantly* document services that
*Release Engineering Team* is providing.

Currently supported platform is **Linux**. In the future we could think of also
supporting OSX (Darwin) as development platform, but initial efforts are on
purpose kept as small as possible.

TODO: explain why we want to converge efforts?
TODO: why mono-repository approach?
TODO: why a single version? why not semver?
