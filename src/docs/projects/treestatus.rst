TreeStatus is a relatively simple tool to keep track of the status of the
**trees** at Mozilla.

**A tree** is a version-control repository, and can generally be in one of
three states: **open**, **closed**, or **approval-required**. These states
affect the ability of developers to push new commits to these repositories.
Trees typically close when something prevents builds and tests from succeeding.

The tree status tool provides an interface for **anyone to see the current
status of all trees**. It also allows "sheriffs" to manipulate tree status.


Start developing
----------------

0. Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'll need:

1. A `Taskcluster`_ account
2. Docker installed on your machine


1. Taskcluster secret
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once logged on Taskcluster, please check that you can view the contents of the
Taskcluster secret : `repo:github.com/mozilla-releng/services:branch:master`_.

This secret holds the configuration for all the services, you can look at the
``treestatus/api`` section for more details.

If you don't have access to that secret, or you need to make some changes to
it, you can create a new secret under the "garbage" namespace (publicly visible
to anyone); and use its name everywhere the ``master`` secret is mentioned in
this documentation.

For example, you can create a secret called
``garbage/LOGIN/treestatus-api-dev`` with this value:

.. code-block:: yaml

  common:
    APP_CHANNEL: master
    AUTH_DOMAIN: auth.mozilla.auth0.com
    SECRET_KEY_BASE64: gDs52OnoHp6YPR7KTQCCC7jGK7PfS0Yn
  treestatus/api:
    AUTH_REDIRECT_URI: 'https://localhost:8010/login'
    AUTH_CLIENT_ID: dummy
    AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: dummy


Just replace ``LOGIN`` with your username (e.g. ``michel``);


2. Taskcluster client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to create a `Taskcluster client`_ to access above created secrets.

Use the form to create a new client in your own namespace (the ``ClientId``
should be pre-filled with ``mozilla-auth0/ad|Mozilla-LDAP|login/``, simply
add an explicit suffix, like ``treestatus-api-dev``)

Add an explicit description, you can leave the ``Expires`` setting into the far
future.

Add the Taskcluster scope needed to read the secret previously mentioned:
``secrets:get:repo:github.com/mozilla-releng/services:branch:master`` (or
``secrets:get:garbage/michel/treestatus-api-dev`` if you're using your own
secret).

To summarize, you need to setup your client (if your login is ``michel``),
like this:

============= =================================================================
Key           Value
============= =================================================================
ClientId      ``mozilla-auth0/ad|Mozilla-LDAP|michel/treestatus-api-dev``
Description   My own treestatus/api dev client
Client Scopes ``secrets:get:garbage/michel/treestatus-api-dev``
============= =================================================================


.. warning::

  Save the **access token** provided by Taskcluster after creating your client,
  it won't be displayed afterwards.


.. _`Taskcluster client`: https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/clients


3. Project shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following (where ``XXX`` is the Taskcluster access token):

.. code-block:: shell

  ./please shell treestatus/api \
    --taskcluster-secret="garbage/michel/treestatus-api-dev" \
    --taskcluster-client-id="mozilla-auth0/ad|Mozilla-LDAP|michel/treestatus-api-dev" \
    --taskcluster-access-token="XXX"

Once the initial build finishes, you should get a green development shell,
running in ``/app/src/treestatus/api``.


4. Run project in development mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following (where ``XXX`` is the Taskcluster access token):

.. code-block:: shell

  ./please shell treestatus/api \
    --taskcluster-secret="garbage/michel/treestatus-api-dev" \
    --taskcluster-client-id="mozilla-auth0/ad|Mozilla-LDAP|michel/treestatus-api-dev" \
    --taskcluster-access-token="XXX"


Giving permission/roles to Sherrifs to close/open trees
-------------------------------------------------------

A common request one administrator of ``treestatus`` would receive is to
give permission for new 

Certain JSON API endpoints are protected by `Taskcluster scopes`_ (for details
which endpoint is protected by you can look at ``api.py``). Those scopes
(permissions) are grouped in two roles:

#. **Admin role**

  Administrator role has all the permissions (scopes) that are available.
  Administrator can create, update and remove trees. By default this role is
  assigned to everybody that is in `vpn_sheriff`_ LDAP group.

  To assign **admin role** to certain user/group you need to add
  ``assume:project:releng:treestatus/admin`` scope to that user/group.

  Roles / Clients with **admin role** are listed `here
  <https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/scopes/assume%3Aproject%3Areleng%3Atreestatus%2Fadmin>`_.

#. **Sheriff role**

  Sheriff role the permissions (scopes) to update status of the trees and to
  revert those updates. This role is usually given to *sheriff's deputies* to
  be able to close/open certain trees.

  Roles / Clients with **admin role** are listed here: https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/scopes/assume%3Aproject%3Areleng%3Atreestatus%2Fsheriff



Troubleshooting
---------------

In case of an incident this five steps that should help you narrow down the
problem.

#. Look at `Heroku metrics
   <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/production-treestatus/metrics/web>`_
   to get birds view on the running application.

#. There might be some problems with Heroku. Make sure to also check their
   `status page <https://status.heroku.com>`_

#. Check if there is any unsual high count of errors collected in Sentry.

#. To see more logs (from the past) look at Papertrail.

#. Sometimes restarting an application might solve the issue (at least
   temporary). Once you restart the application also verify that it is working
   correctly (follow :ref:`instructions below <verify-treestatus>`).


Deploying
---------

``treestatus`` is a Flask application deployed to Heroku. Please follow
the :ref:`Heroku deployment guide <deploy-heroku-target>` how to manually
deploy hotfixes.

The architecture

.. blockdiag::
    :align: center

    orientation = portrait

    A [ label = "URL: https://mozilla-releng.net/treestatus\nPROJECT: releng-frontend\nTARGET: AWS S3"
      , width = 280
      , height = 60
      ];

    B [ label = "URL: https://treestatus.mozilla-releng.net/\nPROJECT: treestatus/api on Heroku"
      , width = 280
      , height = 60
      ];

    C [ label = "PostgreSQL\nTARGET: Heroku"
      , width = 180
      , height = 60
      ];

    A -> B -> C



Is TreeStatus working correctly?
--------------------------------

.. _verify-treestatus:

**To test and verify** that ``treestatus`` is running correctly please
follow the following steps:

#. Select which environement (production or staging).

   For production:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ export URL=https://treestatus.mozilla-releng.net

   For staging:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ export URL=https://treestatus.staging.mozilla-releng.net

#. List all trees

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl $URL/trees
       {
          "result": {
            "ash": {
              "message_of_the_day": "MotDs are a nice thing we can't have.",
              "reason": "",
              "status": "open",
              "tree": "ash"
            },
            ...
          }
       }

#. Show details of an existing tree

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl $URL/trees/mozilla-beta
       {
         "result": {
           "message_of_the_day": "",
           "reason": "",
           "status": "approval required",
           "tree": "mozilla-beta"
         }
       }


#. Show error for non existing tree (return code: 404)

   .. code-block:: console

       $ curl $URL/trees/invalid
       {
         "detail": "No such tree",
         "instance": "about:blank",
         "status": 404,
         "title": "404 Not Found: No such tree",
         "type": "about:blank"
       }


Develop
-------

To start developing ``treestatus`` you would need to:

#. Install all :ref:`requirements <develop-requirements>` and read through
   general :ref:`guide how to contribute <develop-contribute>`.

#. Read through :ref:`python projects guide <develop-python-project>`, how
   python projects are structured and how to add/update dependencies to
   a project.

#. And last you will have to read about conventions we use to :ref:`write REST
   endpoints using Flask <develop-flask-project>`.

   It is important to know that ``treestatus`` uses the following
   Flask extensions:

   - :ref:`log <develop-flask-log-extension>` (centralize logging),
   - :ref:`security <develop-flask-security-extension>` (HTTP security headers),
   - :ref:`cors <develop-flask-cors-extension>` (setting CORS headers who can
     access this url),
   - :ref:`api <develop-flask-api-extension>` (swagger/openapi integration),
   - :ref:`auth <develop-flask-auth-extension>` (authentication and
     authorization via `Taskcluster Auth service`_),
   - :ref:`db <develop-flask-db-extension>` (convinience utilities how to work
     with `SQLAlchemy`_),
   - :ref:`cache <develop-flask-cache-extension>` (integration with
     Flask-Caching),
   - :ref:`pulse <develop-flask-pulse-extension>` (convinience utilities to
     work with Pulse_)
