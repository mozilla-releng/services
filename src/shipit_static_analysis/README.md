Configuration
-------------

As every other services in `mozilla-releng/services`, the static analysis bot is configured through the [Taskcluster secrets service](https://tools.taskcluster.net/secrets)

Each reporter configuration must contain a `reporter` key with a unique name per tool. Each tool has its own configuration requirement.
